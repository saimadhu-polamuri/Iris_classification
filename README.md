## About Iris dataset

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis.It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features


## Attribute Information:

5. class:
